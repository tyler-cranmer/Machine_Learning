    "For the final project, you are required to:    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify a machine learning problem. You can download or scrape data from the web, or use data you collected (e.g. from your smart sensor devices). Or, if you have a relationship with a company or organization who are willing to provide a project task or data, you're welcome to work on their problem. You do not need to share the data, but you should be able to make a public git (that includes your notebook or codes- at least the ML analysis part if sharing all codes are not possible) and video presentation.\n",
    "If you're going to just use a kaggle competition or similar, you must provide more focus on model building and/or analysis to be a valid project (replicating what's in the kaggle kernel or other notebooks available online is not a valid project. If you add other approaches and compare with those, it's valid). If you find a research paper and want to replicate the experiments or implement an algorithm.\n",
    "2. Gather data, determine the method of data collection and provenance of the data. The data can be web-scraped, or downloaded from any sources as long as it's legal and ethical, and does not violate their policy or intellectual property/copyrights.\n",
    "3. Clean the data, do EDA (exploratory data analysis- e.g., inspecting and visualization of the data)\n",
    "4. Perform analysis using machine learning models of your choice. If your project involves making an webapp (not required), you can include the demo.\n",
    "5. Deliver the results: These deliverables serves two purposes- grade for this course and your project portfolio that you can show when you apply for jobs in the near futures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Required]** Jupyter notebook showing a brief problem description, EDA procedure, analysis (model building and training), result and discussion/conclusion. If your work becomes large that it doesn't fit into one notebook (or you think it will be less readable by having one large notebook), you can make several notebooks or scripts in the git (as deliverable 3), and submit a report-style notebook or pdf instead.\n",
    "In case your project doesn't fit into jupyter notebook format (e.g. you built an app that uses ML), write your approach as a report and submit in a pdf form. Please include all of your team members name in the notebook or report.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Optional]** You may choose to include short summary or recorded presentation or git repository or anything that you want to include/demonstrate. Be sure to be concise and clear. This optional step can be used as building your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the rough steps:         \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1** In the earlier phase, you were to make the initial selection of a data source and problem. In this stage, you're going to go through the initial data cleaning and EDA, and judge whether you need to collect more data or different data etc. Feel free to share and discuss your idea in the class discussion board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step 2** Continue more EDA if needed. Start the main analysis (main analysis refers to *supervised learning tasks* such as classification or regression).You are on the right track if you start the main analysis at the latest end of the week 7 or earlier. Depending on your tasks, you may have one model or more. Generally, it is deemed to be a higher quality project if you compare multiple models and show your understanding of why certain model works better than the other or what limitations or cautions certain models may have (and for machine learning models, show enough effort on the hyperparameter optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Step 3** Continue more main analysis. Hyperparameter optimization. Compare results from your models. Wrap up.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Step 4** Wrap up and finalize your jupyter notebook write-up. (Optional: Prepare the presentation. Organize your git repository.) Submit the deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining project idea\n",
    "We will have three mini projects throughout the course. The purpose of mini projects is to apply skills you learned from each part. Therefore, choose a topic and data that are suitable for the methods/models we learned in each part. For example, the first mini project is about various supervised learning methods we learned: linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, tree ensembles (random forest and boosting), and SVM. So the focus of the first mini project is using these methods and compare the performances, discuss pros and cons based on our theory (model's property) and observation about the data. Since we've practiced linear regression and logistic regression in another course, it is better to focus on other sophisticated models we learned (the rest). Also it is a great idea to compare those different methods. When you choose data, try to avoid data that's too simple or too complicated. We recommend to use tabulated data (avoid image and texts unless you know how to extract features- later you'll have an opportunity to work with images and texts so you can skip for now), or at least data that you can extract features easily. If the data is too messy (that require a lot of preprocessing and cleaning) perhaps it is wise to find other data. In terms of data shape, number of features less than 10 may be too simple. Also try to find data that has at least 500-1000 samples, since complex models tend to work better when there are more observations. It is ok to use large number of features 100+, but you may use a strategy of reducing features (e.g. feature selection or PCA) if it's too much and negatively impact your model(s).\n",
    "Also we recommend finding data from ML competition or data repositories rather than scraping from web or multiple sources yourself. Using well organized data will save your time as we have shorter (and frequent) timeline for mini projects than usual final project you may have seen in other classes. You can think of a mini project as a simpler project (that you can work in 1-2 weeks part time). So we recommend not to choose something too ambitious. But if you have time and interest, you're welcome to challenge yourself.\n",

    "- Describe the data sources, the hypothesis or problem you which to analyze and then describe the factors or components that make up the dataset (The \"factors\" here is called \"features\" in the machine learning term. These factors are often columns in the tabulated data). For each factor, use a box-plot, scatter plot, histogram etc to describe the distribution of the data as appropriate.\n",
    "- Describe correlations between different factors of the dataset and justify your assumption that they are correlated or not correlated. You may use numeric or qualitative / graphical analysis for this step.\n",
    "- Determine if any data needs to be transformed. For example, if you're planning on using a SVM method for prediction, you may need to normalize or scale the data if there is considerable difference in the range of the data.\n",
    "- Using your hypothesis, indicate if it's likely that you should transform data, such as using a log transform or other transformation of the dataset.\n",
    "- You should determine if your data has outliers or needs to be cleaned in any way. Are there missing data values for specific factors? How will you handle the data cleaning? Will you discard, interpolate or otherwise substitute data values?\n",
    "- If you believe that specific factors will be more important than others in your analysis, you should mention which and why. You will use this to confirm your intuitions in your final writeup.\n",

    "### How to find data\n",
    "There are a plethora of data resource these days. Here are a few popular (classic ML data) ones.     \n",
    "- [UCI ML data repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php): Their data is from researchers mostly and is relatively clean. Also the task types are mostly for classification or regression, therefore many of them are suitable for the scope of this course's project.     \n",
    "- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): Perhaps one of the most popular data science/ML data repositories today, they have many interesting con-going or past competitions. But most of recent dataset/tasks will be beyond the scope of this course. Should you be still interested, choose problems that have tabulated data and classification or regression type tasks.     \n",
    "- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) has many government sources of data. You can filter for a specific topic (e.g. Finance) and then restrict your attention to e.g. CSV data, which should be easier to process.\n",
    "- [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/) has various biomed image computer vision competitions.\n",
